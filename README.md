## Purpose
  This project serves as a way to practice my coding and development skills in areas such as:

+ `C#/C++`
+ `Python`
+ `Java`
+ `Unity`
+ `Android Studio`
<br>

## Interests
  **Software Development** is a fundamental skill for me. I am not at a level that I wish to be so I decided to work on projects that interest me.
  **XR** is an exciting place to learn in. I have basic knowledge in game development from my studies in high school but it carries me a long way in starting this ptoject.


  > The `X` in `XR` is used as a place holder for the 3 areas of virtually modeling reality:
  > + `Virtual`
  > + `Mixed`
  > + `Augmented`
<br>

## Goal
  To develop an `Android` application that will be used with a phone-based headset *[like google cardboard]*
  #### Tasks: 
  + _allow a user to switch between VR and AR views_
  + _place augmented objects into their surroundings_
